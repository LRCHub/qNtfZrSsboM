Oh, no!

(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

I can't stand still 'cause you've got me goin'
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
Your slacks are low, and your hips are showin'
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

I thank you girl as you're standing there
Your low-cut slacks and your long black hair
I want you going, I want no one else
'Cause when I'm with you, I can't control myself

Defences down and you got me shakin'
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
You got me so that my nerves are breakin'
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

If you knew me like I know you, girl
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl
You make me move, yeah, like no one else
'Cause when I'm with you, I can't control myself

I've got this feeling that's inside of me
It makes me think of how things used to be
It makes me feel all right
When I'm with you at night and we love
And we love

(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

You fill me so with this big temptation
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
This kind of feeling could move a nation
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

But I'm okay when I'm here with you
I do the things that you want me to
I do these things for no one else
But when I'm with you, I can't control myself

(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
I can't control myself (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
I can't control myself (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
I can't control myself, baby (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
Ah (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
